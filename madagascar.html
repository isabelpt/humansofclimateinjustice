    <p> Madagascar is an island nation located in southern Africa, in the Indian Ocean, east of the Mozambique Channel. This island is the fourth largest island in the world with 4828 kilometers of coastline and an area of  587,04l kilometers.square. Madagascar is known for its diversity of unique flora and fauna.  However, climate change is destroying the lives of plants, animals, and humans in this country.</p>

    <h3> Climate Change </h3> 
    <p>Temperatures in countries all over the world are increasing.  This is largely due to the global rise of greenhouse gas emissions. Madagascar’s average temperatures range from 23 to 27 degrees Celsius. However, this is expected to increase by 2.5 to 3.5 degrees Celsius by 2100.</p>

    <h3> Effects of Climate Change: Rising Sea Levels </h3> 
    <p>The increase in temperatures causes polar ice caps to melt and sea levels to rise. The ocean is rising at an annual rate of 7 to 8 millimeters.</p>

    <h3> Effects of Climate Change: Natural Disasters </h3> 
    <p>This increase in temperatures causes central, western, and southern parts of Madagascar to face longer droughts.  These droughts may come every 2 to 7 years.  Other parts of Madagascar face heavy rain.<br>Madagascar is the most vulnerable country in Africa to cyclones. Cyclones occur more than they should: There are 3 to 4 cyclones annually. This nation is a direct path of any storms blowing east from the Indian Ocean.<br>Flooding has become a hazard in Madagascar due to the increasing intensity of cyclones and increasing rainfall.</p>
    
    <h3> Impact on people in Madagascar: Health </h3> 
    <p>The heat in Madagascar has caused a range of disease carrying vectors. People suffer from vector borne diseases, water borne diseases, lack of nutrition, heat related mortality,and acute respiratory diseases.<br>Higher temperatures cause droughts. As a result, there is less water for people and for crops. This only causes more people to suffer from food insecurity. 40% of the population is anemic, partially because of lack of nutrition.</p>

    <h3> Impact on people in Madagascar: Agriculture</h3> 
    <p>Different parts of Madagascar bear the brunt of both intense flooding and droughts. Either way, there are negative effects on the economy. Flooding, droughts, erosion, and soil degradation damage crops and kill livestock. This affects workers as 75% of Madagascar’s population works in the agriculture field.  In addition, 71.1% of agricultural land is used. For example, there were more droughts in 2016 due to El Nino. This led to losses of up to 95% of the harvest.<br>Damage to infrastructure has largely impacted Madagascar’s economy.  Repairs cost up to 470-940 million USD annually.</p>
      
    <h3> Impact on animals in Madagascar </h3> 
    <p>Madagascar is known for its large diversity of fascinating animals, as its island holds 5% of all species. Sadly, species such as the ring tailed lemur have become endangered. Floods, cyclones, and rising sea levels have destroyed their homes, Mangrove forests. Marine diversity is also affected as warm temperatures and pollution has caused marine life to be at risk.  Coral reefs are dying in Madagascar.</p>
