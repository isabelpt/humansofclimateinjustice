    <h1>Bahamas</h1>
    <h2>Intro & Tourism</h2>
    <p>389,482 people live in the Bahamas and each one of them are negatively impacted by climate change. The Bahamas depends on tourism because many people come to visit the country to see the beautiful coral reefs and to relax on the many beaches. However, those coral reefs are rapidly dying which means that fewer people will come to visit. This impacts the livelihoods of many Bahamians because they will loose their jobs. </p>
    <h2>Fishing</h2>
    <p>Many species of fish depend on reefs, so as coral dies they are loosing their natural habitat. It is becoming more difficult for fisherman to catch fish and people are loosing their main food source.</p>
    <h2>Hurricanes & Flooding</h2>
    <p>Coral reefs buffer 97% of energy from waves which means that the death of coral is resulting in more damaging hurricanes. The Bahamas is already prone to flooding because more that 80% of the land is less than a meter above sea level, but the loss of coral reefs will only make flooding worse. It is predicted that around 12% of land in the Bahamas will be lost. Many people are and will loose their homes if nothing is done about climate change.</p>
