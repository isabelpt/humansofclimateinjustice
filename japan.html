    <p> Climate Change has steadily worsened over the past century, and Japan is going to be one of the worst countries affected. In 2019, Japan had the lowest recorded snowfall since 1961 with less than half the annual average. With the increasing heat and rising sea levels each year, Japan's agriculture and economy is greatly damaged by climate change. 
      </p>

    <h3> Agriculture </h3>
    <p> Japan's agriculture is primarily made up of rice as well as wheat, soybeans, and a variety of fruit and vegetables. As the temperature steadily rises and more frequent abnormal weather occurs, the agricultural economy takes massive hits. The quality of grains decrease since high temperatures can cause cracks in the rice. Moreover, the heat causes fruits to be damaged such as sunburn or discoloration in the skin. Because of this, more crops go to waste making the agricultural economy to be majorly imapacted by it.  
      
    <h3> Coastal Threats </h3> 
    <p> Due to the rising sea levels, Japan is taking coastal damage from major torrential waves. A big case of this happened in September of 2019 where an international airport was flooded by Typhoon Jebi. This caused more than $3 million in damages and many displaced homes in Kyoto, Osaka, and Kobe. Moreover, the increasing heat causes the evaporation of water to happen more rapidly causing less frequent rainfall, but a harder dounpour. In July of 2018, this caused thousands of homes to be flooded and more than 200 deaths. As global temperatures rises, sea levels will continue to rise making Japan be in danger in the coming years. </p>

    <h3> The Impact On The People </h3>
    <p> Although climate change is not tangible, it is a major problem. Heavy rainfall, typhoons, intense heatwaves, low snowfall, and more affects the lives of Japanese citizens every day. If Carbon Dioxide levels don't decrease in the coming years, the economy, agriculture, and environment will be highly negatively impacted. </p>
